__Vy:nil__ is a research WPF-based audioplayer project, mostly designed as proof-of-concept.  
Powered simulatenously by [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) technologies, it aims to explore their integration difficulties.  
❗ As it's in pre-alpha state, _no actual releases is provided yet_. ❗

# ⋮Reassembling⋮
__Vy:nil__ is being developed in [CoffeeScript 2](http://cofeescript.org/v2/), all centered around [CSCore](https://github.com/filoe/cscore) audio library.  
Based on no longer actively maintained [nodeclr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clr) API bridge, it requires _node v0.8.x_ to function.  
Run `coffee main.cs` to boot player app.
